## About Me

Hi there! I'm a front-end web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional websites that make a positive impact. When I'm not coding, you can find me competing as an arena FIDE Master or diving deep into the mysteries of theoretical physics. I love exploring the complexities of the universe and bringing that same sense of curiosity and wonder to everything I do. Let's build something great together!
